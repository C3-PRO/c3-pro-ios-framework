C3-PRO
======

**iOS** framework, written in Swift, for our [C3-PRO][] research framework.
Combining [üî• FHIR][fhir] and [ResearchKit][] for data storage into [i2b2][], this framework allows you to use FHIR _Questionnaire_ resources directly with ResearchKit and will return FHIR _QuestionnaireResponse_ to your server.
In addition, a FHIR _Contract_ resource can be used to carry trial eligibility requirements and define content to be shown during consenting.
Subsequently, the contract can be signed when consenting completes successfully to indicate consent.

There are additional utilities for _geolocation_, _de-identification_ and _data queueing_ that go well with a research app.

The `master` branch currently supports _Swift 2.0_ and _FHIR 0.5.0_ and requires Xcode 7.
The `develop` branch is on _FHIR 1.0.2_.
For other versions see the [releases](releases) tab, for newer versions look for `feature/x` branches.

See the [install instructions](Install.md), then use `C3PRO` in your code and start coding:

```swift
import C3PRO
```


Components
----------

The framework consists of several components that complement each other.

### Study Introduction

Shows the well-known _‚ÄúWelcome to my study‚Äù_ screens that allows users to inform themselves before joining your study.  
[‚ûî Study Intro](StudyIntro)

### Eligibility & Consent

Using a FHIR `Contract` resource representing the **consent document**, can render eligibility questions and the consenting workflow.  
[‚ûî Consent](Consent)

### Questionnaires

Enables use of a FHIR `Questionnaire` resource as direct input to a ResearchKit **survey** task and return the encoded answers as a FHIR resource.
Also serves as return format of **activity data** collected on the phone.  
[‚ûî Questionnaire](Questionnaire)

### DataQueue

`DataQueue` is a FHIR server implementation used to move FHIR resources, created on device, to a FHIR server, without the need for user interaction nor -confirmation.  
[‚ûî DataQueue](DataQueue)

### HealthKit Extensions

Extensions to _HealthKit_ classes to easily query for samples and to represent quantities in FHIR.  
[‚ûî HealthKit](HealthKit)

### Encryption

AES and RSA encryption facilities that come in handy.  
[‚ûî Encryption](Encryption)

### Identity and De-Identification

Helps creating de-identified patient resources, consistent with _HIPAA Safe Harbor_ guidelines, with birthdate and ZIP truncated accordingly.
