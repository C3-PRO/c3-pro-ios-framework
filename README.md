This is the **iOS** framework, written in Swift, for our [C3-PRO][] research framework.

Combining [üî• FHIR][fhir] and [ResearchKit][], usually for data storage into [i2b2][], this framework allows you to use FHIR _Questionnaire_ resources directly with ResearchKit and will return FHIR _QuestionnaireResponse_ that you can send to your server.
In addition, a FHIR _Contract_ resource can be used to carry trial eligibility requirements and define content to be shown during consenting.
Subsequently, the contract can be ‚Äúsigned‚Äù with a FHIR _Patient_ resource and returned to your server, indicating consent.

There are additional utilities for _encryption_, _geolocation_, _de-identification_ and _data queueing_ that go well with a research app.
These are individual modules, meaning you can use only the parts you need.
See below for what's included.

#### Usage

Taking a _pure Swift_ approach, you will not be able to use this framework with Objective-C alone.
Instead, you can use Swift code in your app, using a [mix and match][mix-match] approach, to connect the C3-PRO components to the Objective-C bits in your app.

[‚§µÔ∏è Installation](INSTALL.md)  
[üì± Sample App][sample app]  
[üìñ Technical Documentation][docs]

```swift
import C3PRO
```


#### Versions

The `master` branch requires Xcode 7.3 and _should_ always be compatible with the latest version released.
The `develop` branch may contain new developments and have different requirements.
See the [releases](releases) tab for previous releases, for newer versions look for `feature/x` branches.

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for updates.
This framework combines several versioned technologies, here's an overview over what's included:

   Version |   Swift | ResearchKit |  FHIR
-----------|---------|-------------|------
   **2.0** |     3.0 |         1.3 | 1.7.0
   **1.9** |     3.0 |         1.3 | 1.6.0
   **1.8** |     3.0 |         1.3 | 1.0.2
   **1.2** |     2.2 |         1.3 | 1.6.0
   **1.1** |     2.2 |         1.3 | 1.0.2
 **1.0.1** |     2.2 |         1.3 | 1.0.2
   **1.0** | 2.0-2.2 |         1.3 | 1.0.2


Modules
-------

The framework consists of several modules that complement each other.

### Study Introduction

Shows the well-known _‚ÄúWelcome to my study‚Äù_ screens that allows users to inform themselves before joining your study.  
[‚ûî Study Intro](./Sources/StudyIntro/)

### Eligibility & Consent

Using a FHIR `Contract` resource representing the **consent document**, can render eligibility questions and the consenting workflow.  
[‚ûî Consent](./Sources/Consent/)

### Questionnaires

Enables use of a FHIR `Questionnaire` resource as direct input to a ResearchKit **survey** task and return the encoded answers as a FHIR resource.
Also serves as return format of **activity data** collected on the phone.  
[‚ûî Questionnaire](./Sources/Questionnaire/)

### DataQueue

`DataQueue` is a FHIR server implementation used to move FHIR resources, created on device, to a FHIR server, without the need for user interaction nor -confirmation.  
[‚ûî DataQueue](./Sources/DataQueue/)

### HealthKit & CoreMotion (Activity Data)

`ActivityReporter` implementations for _HealthKit_ and _CoreMotion_.
The latter includes persistence of activity data past the 7 days iOS default.
Extensions to _HealthKit_ classes to easily query for samples and to represent quantities in FHIR.  
[‚ûî HealthKit](./Sources/HealthKit/)

### System Service Permissions

Facilities to request permission to send notifications, access HealthKit and others.
These can be integrated into the Consent flow.  
[‚ûî SystemServices](./Sources/SystemServices)

### Encryption

AES and RSA encryption facilities that come in handy.
These work with facilities officially exposed by iOS, meaning you **don't need to add OpenSSL** to your app.  
[‚ûî Encryption](./Sources/Encryption/)

### De-Identification & Geocoder

Helps creating de-identified patient resources, consistent with _HIPAA Safe Harbor_ guidelines, with birthdate and ZIP (determined by _Geocoder_) truncated accordingly.  
[‚ûî DeIdentifier](./Sources/DeIdentifier/)


Localization
------------

The framework uses `NSLocalizedString` on the `C3PRO` table name, meaning it's looking at the C3PRO.strings file for string localization.
There is an extension on _String_ so we can simply use `"My Text".c3_localized` in code.
If you're looking for localizable strings in code, search for this variable.
